# School Projects Repository

## Overview
Welcome to my School Projects Repository! This repository contains all of the work I have completed during my studies. It showcases a variety of projects, assignments, and exercises across different subjects and courses.


## Projects
### Project 1: Cars
**Description**: Website that showcases information about different car models, their specifications, manufacturers, and more.

### Project 2: Art-interface
**Description**: A simple server in Go, which makes it possible to use a web interface to input text and display the resulting artwork.

### Project 3: Itinerary
**Description**: A command line tool which can prettify flight itineraries.

### Project 4: Literary-lions
**Description**: Web forum that allows users to communicate, associate categories with posts, like/dislike posts & comments, and filter posts.

### Project 5: Match Me
**Description**: Full-stack recommendation platform that connects users based on their interests, preferences, and profiles. Whether you're seeking friendship, professional networking, or a hobby partner, Match-Me Web helps you find the perfect match.

### Project 6: Web Game
**Description**: Fast-paced, real-time multiplayer game built for 2 to 4 players, playable entirely through web browsers without HTML canvas. Players control adorable cats competing to collect coins while avoiding obstacles and racing against the clock.

### Project 7: Literal Maintainer "Hired" 
**Description**: An introductory cross-platform mobile application to help keep track of home maintenance jobs — built with Flutter. Hired is a simple job-tracking app designed to help individuals like Maya, a home-maintenance engineer, manage their work more efficiently than with paper spreadsheets. Instead of using generic to-do apps, Maya needed something specific to her workflow — a way to track jobs, clients, payments, and job status.
